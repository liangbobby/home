		<p><div class="a"><p> Niagara Falls is the most visited and ranks number #1 on the best tourist attractions in Canada on our list. The 12,000 year old Niagara Falls
		has yet to stop flowing since 1848 due to an ice jam. When visiting the Falls, don't forget to bring your camera as you would not want to miss these 
		breathtaking waterfalls, especially at night, where the Falls light up in many colours. Did you know that the volume of water that flows down the Falls 
		can fill up to a million bathtubs per minute! For a closer view of the Falls, take the "Journey Behind the Falls" tour where you descend 150 feet to observation decks to get an up-close view of 
		Horseshoe Falls. For the ones that would like to stay dry, visit the tourist attractions on Clifton Hill. Activities range from glow-in-the-dark mini-golf, the 
		"Bird Kingdom", and the "Ripley's Believe it or Not" museum and many more. If you're not afraid of heights, zoom up the "Clifton Tower" and "Niagara Skywheel"
		to see astonishing aerial views of the Falls and city itself. Still bored? Enjoy yourself at the Fallsview Indoor Waterpark, three acres full of 16
		waterslides, indoor wave pool, hot springs etc. Niagara Falls has attracted about 30 million visitors per year and the number continues to increase every year.</p>
