		<p><div class="a"> Stanley Park is one of the best tourist destinations in British Columbia and was rated the
			world's best park in 2014. It is also Vancouver's largest and oldest park. With 400 hectares (1,000 acres)
			in area, there are many activities to do such as visiting the largest aquarium in Canada, the Vancouver 
			Aquarium. If you do not have much time to tour, try to hike the 8.8km trail section of the seawall that surrounds 
			the park. You would be able to see the spectacular views of Vancouver, the Lion's Gate Bridge, and the North 
			Shore Mountains. Stanley Park attracts about eight million people per year and is one of the best tourist 
			destinations in Canada. </p>
