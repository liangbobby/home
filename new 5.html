		<p><div class="a"> Banff National Park is one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in Alberta. In the summer, you could visit the many lakes the 
		park has to offer including Lake Moraine (where the photo was taken from, the famous Lake Louise, or take a hike on the Glacier Skywalk, 
		where you are 280 meters above ground over a glacier-formed valley. In the winter-time, take the Banff Gondola, an eight-minute ride to the summit 
		of Sulphur Mountain and take magnificent photos from above, or go skiing or snowboarding down parts of the Rocky Mountain for a thrilling experience.
		Banff National Park has activites year-round and attracts four million visitors every year. </p>
