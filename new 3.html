		<p><div class="a"> Peggy's Cove is one of Canada's most beloved landmarks because of its stellar scenary of 
		the Atlantic Ocean and its iconic lighthouse marks the eastern entrance of St. Margaret's Bay. The lighthouse
		is still operating, watching over ocean waves and lobster boats until this day. Take a hike in the thousand acre
		Peggy's Cove Preservation Area where glaciers shaped the land 12,000 years ago. Stay cautious when exploring 
		Peggy's Cove by staying off the black rocks as the waves crashing along the shore could wash people away. </p>
